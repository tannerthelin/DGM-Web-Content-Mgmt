        <h3>Biography:</h3>
        <p> I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. At the age of 12 I asked if I could fly by myself to Hawaii and I never came back. Right out of high school I started into travel school and have had the opportunity to work in many aspects of the industry. In every aspect I have worked I have had the opportunity to help people travel, to help fulfill people?s dreams, what could be be6er to do every day!</p>
