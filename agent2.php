        <h3>Biography:</h3>
        <p>I went on my first trip to Europe in 1987 when I was in college. This tour, with a group of my friends, took me to Greece, Italy, and Israel. I was a “travel rookie,” having never ventured outside the Southeastern USA! Imagine my excitement as I boarded the airliner for my first flight, not to mention the wonder of touching down in Greece, a distant land of which I’d only read about in my Sunday School lessons! Fast forward 30 years and I'm traveling all the time, and have devoted my life to helping others find their travel plans.</p>
